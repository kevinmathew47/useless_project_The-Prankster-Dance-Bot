# The Prankster Dance Bot üéØ


## Basic Details

## Kevin Mathew

### Project Description
The Prankster Dance Bot is a whimsical robot that springs to life and dances unpredictably whenever it detects movement nearby. Its sole purpose is to surprise and entertain, adding a delightful and unexpected touch of humor to any space.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many rooms are dull and uneventful. People need spontaneous, surprise entertainment to brighten up their day without any pre-scheduled dance parties or music.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Prankster Dance Bot‚Äîa bot that detects movement and immediately starts grooving with unpredictable dance moves. It‚Äôs the ultimate boredom-buster that nobody knew they needed!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
# For Software:
- Languages used: C++ (for programming the ESP32 microcontroller)
- Frameworks used: Arduino IDE
- Libraries used: Servo library, MPU6050 library (for motion sensor control)
- Tools used: Arduino IDE, ESP32 package, Serial Monitor for debugging
# For Hardware:
- Main Components:
-- ESP32 microcontroller
- IR motion sensor
- MPU6050 sensor (to sense its own orientation and movements)
- Servo motor for dance moves
# Specifications:
- ESP32: 240 MHz dual-core, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities
- Servo motor: 180-degree range of motion for exaggerated dance moves
- IR sensor range: Adjustable sensitivity to detect nearby motion
# Tools Required:
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
- Install the Arduino IDE.
- Add the ESP32 board to Arduino by going to Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs and pasting the ESP32 URL.
- Install necessary libraries: Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries

# Run
- Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
- Upload the code by selecting the correct board and port in Tools.
- Open the Serial Monitor to check sensor data and debug as needed.
